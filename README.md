# Emotion-Detection-Using-OpenCV
Using the Python OpenCV Library the camera will detect the face and compare it to the database and predict the emotion like 'Anger','Fear','Surprise','Happy'and 'Sad'

### Abstract:

Facial recognition is a very useful tool and has been explored extensively in recent years. The applications for facial recognition vary from use in security cameras to emotion detection. Emotion detection in particular is a facet of facial recognition that has great potential in a wide range of fields. In order to tailor the software for emotion detection, a series of steps must be taken. Starting with a database containing positive images (images portraying a specific emotion), a second database must be created that contains negative images (images without a face). Proposed work presented has used the techniques to perform training from the two databases. The classifier is then implemented into the software via a function. This process should ultimately allow for successful emotion detection that can be used in many different applications and shows the significant improvement in result.

### Steps:

- `Emotion_Detection.py`: Detect faces inside a image (one frame)
- `videotester.py`: Detect faces inside a video file
- `tempCodeRunnerFile.py`: Destroy All Windows
